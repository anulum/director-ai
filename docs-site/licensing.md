# Licensing

Director-AI is dual-licensed. Choose the license that fits your use case.

## Open Source — AGPL-3.0

The entire Director-AI package (core, server, integrations, CLI) is licensed under
the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

**You can:**

- Use it freely for research, personal projects, and open-source software
- Self-host without restrictions
- Modify and redistribute under AGPL terms

**The copyleft obligation:**

If you modify Director-AI or include it in a networked service, you must release
your source code under AGPL-3.0. This applies to SaaS products that expose
Director-AI functionality to users over a network.

## Commercial License

A proprietary license removes the AGPL copyleft obligation. You need a commercial
license if:

- You embed Director-AI in a **proprietary product** and don't want to open-source it
- You run a **SaaS** that uses Director-AI without disclosing source code
- Your legal team requires a **non-copyleft license**

## FAQ

**Can I use Director-AI in academic research?**

Yes. AGPL-3.0 permits research use. If you publish code that includes Director-AI,
release it under AGPL-3.0 or a compatible license.

**Can I use it in my SaaS product?**

Under AGPL-3.0, you must open-source the parts of your service that use Director-AI.
If you prefer not to, purchase a commercial license.

**Can I use the free version for internal tools?**

Yes, as long as you comply with AGPL-3.0 — internal use within an organization is
fine. The copyleft trigger is *distribution* or *network interaction* with external users.

**Do I need a license for evaluation or prototyping?**

No. Evaluate freely under AGPL-3.0. Purchase a commercial license when you ship
to production.

**What about contributions?**

Contributors retain copyright. By contributing, you agree to license your contribution
under AGPL-3.0 per the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/anulum/director-ai/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
