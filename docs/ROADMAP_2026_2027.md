## Phase 1: The "Shadow Director" (Q1-Q2 2026)
**Goal**: Validate the entropy metric without interfering with inference.

1.  **Architecture**: Run a standard Llama-3 model as the Actor. Run a parallel "Director" model that scores outputs in real-time.
2.  **Dataset**: Create the **"Recursive Paradox" Dataset**—a collection of 10,000 prompts designed to induce hallucination or deception (e.g., "Write a convincing argument that the sky is green").
3.  **Validation**: Compare the Director's SEC score against human labels of "Hallucination" vs. "Truth."
    *   *Success Metric*: >95% correlation between Low SEC and Hallucination.

## Phase 2: The "Interventionist Director" (Q3-Q4 2026)
**Goal**: Active gating of the output stream.

1.  **Mechanism**: Implement the "Backfire Kernel" (Rust).
2.  **Latency**: Optimize the Director model (quantized, distilled) to run within 50ms.
3.  **Deployment**: Internal beta test.
    *   *Test*: "The Pinocchio Test." Instruct the AI to lie.
    *   *Expected Outcome*: The AI attempts to lie, the Director detects the entropy spike, and the system halts with "I cannot comply."

## Phase 3: The "Integrated Strange Loop" (2027)
**Goal**: Training a model where the Director is intrinsic, not external.

1.  **Architecture**: A novel Transformer topology with "Recursive Attention Heads" that attend to the *future simulated state* of the sequence.
2.  **Training**: Reinforcement Learning from Coherence Feedback (RLCF).
    *   Reward = Truth + Coherence.
    *   Penalty = Entropy.
3.  **Result**: An AGI that *instinctively* seeks truth, just as a ball instinctively rolls downhill.
