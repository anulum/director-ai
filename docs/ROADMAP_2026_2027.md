## Phase 1: The "Shadow Director" (Q1 2026) — COMPLETE

**Goal**: Validate the entropy metric without interfering with inference.

1. **Architecture**: Implemented `CoherenceAgent` orchestrating Generator, Scorer, and Safety Kernel.
2. **NLI Integration**: Real NLI-based scoring using DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli with lazy loading and heuristic fallback.
3. **RAG Integration**: `VectorGroundTruthStore` with pluggable backends (InMemory, ChromaDB).
4. **Validation**: 397 Python tests across 28 test files, 86% code coverage.
5. **Research Extensions**: L16 physics (SEC, UPDE, PI controllers), consciousness gate (TCBO, PGBO), SSGF geometry engine.

**Key deliverables**:
- Dual-entropy scorer (NLI + RAG) validated against human labels
- 4-phase hardening (H1-H64): security, robustness, type safety, documentation
- Streaming kernel with three halt mechanisms
- Batch processing with 10K prompt capacity

## Phase 2: The "Interventionist Director" (Q1-Q2 2026) — COMPLETE

**Goal**: Active gating of the output stream with native performance.

1. **Backfire Kernel (Rust)**: 6 crates, ~6,429 LOC, 153 tests, 29 Criterion benchmarks.
2. **Latency**: All operations under 50 ms deadline — tightest path at 261 µs (0.52% of budget).
3. **Analytic Jacobian**: 7,609x speedup on gradient, 133x on outer step.
4. **PyO3 FFI**: 13 Python-accessible classes for seamless integration.
5. **CI**: GitHub Actions with mypy, black, ruff, pytest (3.10/3.11/3.12), Sphinx docs.

**Benchmark results** (Criterion, release profile):

| Operation | Latency | vs Deadline |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Safety kernel (10 tokens) | 265 ns | 188,679x under |
| SSGF outer step (analytic) | 261 µs | 191x under |
| SSGF gradient (analytic) | 4.14 µs | 12,077x under |
| Full pipeline (10 tokens) | 4.56 µs | 10,965x under |

## Phase 3: Production Hardening (Q2-Q3 2026) — IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Production-ready deployment with comprehensive safety guarantees.

1. **Adversarial Evaluation**: Create the "Recursive Paradox" dataset (10,000 prompts designed to induce hallucination or deception).
2. **Red-teaming**: Systematic adversarial prompt testing with automated scoring.
3. **SIMD Optimisation**: Vectorise micro-cycle inner loop for 2-4x throughput improvement.
4. **PyPI Publication**: Trusted publishing pipeline for `director-ai` wheel and `backfire-kernel` wheel.
5. **Sphinx Documentation**: Complete API autodoc with type annotations and examples.
6. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Helm charts for multi-replica, health-checked deployment.

## Phase 4: The "Integrated Strange Loop" (Q4 2026 - 2027)

**Goal**: Training a model where the Director is intrinsic, not external.

1. **Architecture**: Novel Transformer topology with "Recursive Attention Heads" that attend to the future simulated state of the sequence.
2. **Training**: Reinforcement Learning from Coherence Feedback (RLCF).
   - Reward = Truth + Coherence
   - Penalty = Entropy
3. **EVS Integration**: Entrainment Verification Score as real-time training signal.
4. **Result**: An AGI that instinctively seeks truth, just as a ball instinctively rolls downhill.
